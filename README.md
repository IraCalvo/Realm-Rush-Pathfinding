Within this version of Realm Rush is there is pathfinding within this game that the enemies follow and that there is no pre-determined path that the 
enemies must follow. The algorithm that the enemies use for pathfinding is Breadth's First Search. With this it allows the Player to have a more
dynamic feel and interaction with the world level, making it so that the player could try and make their own path that the enemies must follow.
Additionally there are a few extra balance changes and Features and new map.

What this project includes:
- Breadth's First Search Algorithm for the enemies
- Dynamic Building for the Player so that the Player cannot block all paths so that there are no paths for the enemies
- Object Pooling
- Node based graph
- Build time for towers
- Currency/Resource system
- Difficulty Scaling
